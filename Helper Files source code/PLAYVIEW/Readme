 NOTE: Optionally an external config file may be used with playview. If the config file  "playview.conf"  exist in the
 current working directory, then the app will automatically read configuation from the external configuration file 
 instead of the internal resouce configuration file.

NOTES:
If a copy of the "playview.conf" file from the RESOURCE dir is placed in the same current working directory as the app, then "playview" will read it's configuration from this external conf file instead of the internal conf resource file. this will allow for setting configuration externally.

App has a single POPUP menu. Right click on app for popup menu or press CTRL+m
