HOW TO COMPILE DATA RESOURCES INTO THE simpleMsgDialog EXECUTABLE!!!!

See GResource -- Resource framework in dev-help

THIS IS  THE NAME OF THE SOURCE CODE FILE
simpleMsgDialogGresource.xml

THE EXISTING RESOURCE FILES MAY BE VIEWED AS FOLLOWS:
gresource details simpleMsgDialog

THE ONLY FILE THAT NEEDS TO BE BUILT IS THE C SOURCE CODE.
BUILD THE RESOURCE C CODE AS FOLLOWS:

cd RESOURCES

glib-compile-resources simpleMsgDialogGresource.xml --generate-source  --target=simpleMsgDialog-resource.c

GENERATES FILE simpleMsgDialog-resource.C.source
RENAME simpleMsgDialog-resource.C.source TO simpleMsgDialog-resource.c
THEN MOVE/COPY/OVERWRITE THE EXISTING simpleMsgDialog-resource.c FILE IN THE SRC CODE DIRECTORY


THEN COMPILE THE C CODE and RESOURES INTO simpleMsgDialog EXECTUABLE
cd ..

make clean && make version && make

THAT IS PRETTY MUCH IT

THE COMPILED IN RESOURCE(S) MAY BE EXTRACTED FROM THE simpleMsgDialog EXECUTABLE AS FOLLOWS:
gresource  extract simpleMsgDialog  /simpleMsgDialog/simpleMsgDialog.glade > simpleMsgDialog.glade-extracted
gresource  extract simpleMsgDialog  /simpleMsgDialog/simpleMsgDialog.css > simpleMsgDialog.css-extracted
gresource  extract simpleMsgDialog  /simpleMsgDialog/How_to_compile_songview_resources.txt > How_to_compile_songview_resources.txt-extracted
gresource  extract simpleMsgDialog  /simpleMsgDialog/simpleMsgDialogGresource.xml > simpleMsgDialogGresource.xml-extracted
