By default the icons are not compiled into the executable as a resource.

How to compile icons, TrackIcon.png,  FolderIcon.png,  SubFolderIcon.png  into the "dataview" app as a resource
at the command line:
cd RESOURCES

edit the dataviewGresource.xml file and remove the ? from these 3 lines

    <?file>TrackIcon.png</file?>
	<?file>FolderIcon.png</file?>
	<?file>SubFolderIcon.png</file?>

copy 3 icons of your choice into the RESOURCES folder named as (or linked as), TrackIcon.png,   FolderIcon.png,	SubFolderIcon.png,
then compile dataview-resource.c in this directory.

at the command line:
glib-compile-resources dataviewGresource.xml --generate-source  --target=dataview-resource.c

move the newly compiled resurce file dataview-resource.c to the "dataview.c" source directory
compile dataview as follows

at the command line:
mv dataview-resource.c ../
cd ..

at the command line:
make clean && make version && make


NOTES:
If a copy of the "dataview.conf" file from the RESOURCE dir is placed in the same current working directory as the app,
then "dataview" will read it's configuration from this external conf file instead of the internal conf resource file.
this will allow for setting configuration externally.

To use icons of your choice rather than stock icons or compiled resource icons, then edit these 3 config variables in the external "dataview.conf" file located in the current working directory.

# REQUIRES ABSOLUTE PATH/FILENAME
# THIS IS THE TOP DIRECTORY
topDirectoryIconFile=/myPath/to/DATAVIEW/APP/MyTop.png
#
# THIS IS THE SUB DIRECTORIES
subDirectoryIconFile=/myPath/to/DATAVIEW/APP/MySub.png
#
# THIS IS THE TRACK ICONS
trackIconFile=/myPath/to/DATAVIEW/APP/MyTrk.png

Leave these 3 variables blank i.e.  subDirectoryIconFile=  to use built in icons
