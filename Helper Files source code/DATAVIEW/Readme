 NOTE: Optionally an external config file may be used with dataview. If the config file  dataview.conf  exist in the
       current working directory, then the app will automatically read configuation from the external configuration file
       instead of the internal resouce configuration file.

NOTES:
If a copy of the "dataview.conf" file from the RESOURCE dir is placed in the same current working directory as the app,
then "dataview" will read it's configuration from this external conf file instead of the internal conf resource file.
this will allow for setting configuration externally.

To use icons of your choice rather than stock icons or compiled resource icons, then edit these 3 config variables in the external "dataview.conf" file located in the current working directory.

# REQUIRES ABSOLUTE PATH/FILENAME
# THIS IS THE TOP DIRECTORY
topDirectoryIconFile=/myPath/to/DATAVIEW/APP/MyTop.png
#
# THIS IS THE SUB DIRECTORIES
subDirectoryIconFile=/myPath/to/DATAVIEW/APP/MySub.png
#
# THIS IS THE TRACK ICONS
trackIconFile=/myPath/to/DATAVIEW/APP/MyTrk.png

Leave these 3 variables blank i.e.  subDirectoryIconFile=  to use built in icons
