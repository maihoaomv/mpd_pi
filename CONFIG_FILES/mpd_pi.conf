# gresource  extract trackview /trackview/trackview.conf  > trackview.conf-extracted
# or, if desired, all resource files may be extracted by issuing CTRL+SHIFT+L. Note: if the files exist they will be over-written,
#

########################## CSS  Configuration ##########################
#
# < COMMENT > These "on the fly" CSS properties will override or add to the existing properties specified in the mpd_pi.css (internal or external) file.
# Note: See GTK3 documentation "Supported CSS Properties" in DevHelp for more information
#
# Each variable must be a single line and CAN NOT be spread over 2 or more lines without giving it a CSS_Variable_X assignement.
# Each variable must be sequentially numbered, I.E. 1 2 3 etc., followered with the last variable as  "END",
# but  DO NOT necessary have to be in sequential order.
# Note: A variable may be assigned an empty string as a place holder in the sequence. I.E. CSS_Variable_33=
# Otherwise any gaps in the variable numbering will throw an error.
#
# This is an example of how the variables are structured..
# CSS_Variable_0=START
# CSS_Variable_1=menu { font:  40px Sans; }
# CSS_Variable_... etc., etc.
# CSS_Variable_15=window { font:  20px Sans; color: @window_text_color; }
# CSS_Variable_16=END
#
# CSS_Variable_0 must be "start" and the last variable (CSS_Variable_X) must be "end" (the key words are not case sensistive)
# Note: If CSS_Variable_0, IS NOT "START" (I.E.  CSS_Variable_0=ignore
# or anything except "Start"), then the app will ignore and not process the variables.
# THE LAST VARIABLE IN THE NUMBER SEQUENCE MUST BE "END" (it's not case sensistive)
# Valid parameters are: any valid CSS expression.
CSS_Variable_0=START

CSS_Variable_1=
CSS_Variable_2=
CSS_Variable_3=
CSS_Variable_4=
CSS_Variable_5=

CSS_Variable_6=End

# Note: The last variable in the sequence must be "END"
# It merely tells the sequence counter when to stop processing
# It may be anywhere in the list, even at the very top before variable zero
#
# The variable numbering doesn't necessary have to be in sequential ordering
# as long as there are no gaps in the sequence
