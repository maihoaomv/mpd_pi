Download the tar ball and extract the contents into a sub-folder leaving the tree structue as is

This should build on Debain, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Raspberrypi OS and other debain derivatives. 
It may also build on Fedora and ArchLinux and others.
But it will NOT compile on Windows.

To compile this app you may need to install
libgtk-3-dev
libmpdclient-dev

Open a terminal in the mpd_pi-main folder
At the command line:
make clean && make version && make

This should create the exectuable file mpd_pi

You will also need to compile dataview, playview and simpleMsgDialog in the 
"Helper Files source code" sub-directory then copy the executable files to the "HELPER_FILES" sub-directory.


You may also need to install and configure the Music Player Daemon server
mpd
mpc

If you want to modify code and/or configure mpd_pi you may need to install
glade
devhelp

Any code text editor such as scite, vim, gedit or any text editor should work.
I generally don't use an IDE.

mpd_pi does not have an install option. If you set up the directory structure as I have here, mpd_pi should work 
from any directory on your hard drive. Then link mpd_pi executable to an applet in the panel.
