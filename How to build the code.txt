Download the tar ball and extract the contents into a sub-folder leaving the tree structue as is

This should build on Debain, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Raspberrypi OS and other debain derivatives. 
It may also build on Fedora and ArchLinux and others.
But it will NOT compile on Windows.

To compile this app you may need to install
libgtk-3-dev
libmpdclient-dev

Open a terminal in the mpd_pi-main folder
At the command line:
make clean && make version && make

This should create the exectuable file mpd_pi

You will also need to compile dataview, playview and simpleMsgDialog in the 
"Helper Files source code" sub-directory then copy the executable files to the "HELPER_FILES" sub-directory.

To run mpd_pi from command line 

The default mpd server hostname is "localhost"
thus ./mpd_pi will query the localhost mpd server.
If server is running, the the GUI startup and display the current mpd track queue
with the current playing track centered in the GUI.
Otherwise if mpd_pi can not get a connection to the localhost mpd server, a popup error dialog will be displayed.


For help from the command line, type
mpd_pi -h
Application Options:
  -c, --cfg-file=/home/user/mpd_pi.conf     Absolute path/filename of config file.
  -H, --hostname=rpi3.local                 MPD server hostname or IP address.
  -P, --port=6600                           MPD server port number.
  -T, --timeout=30000                       MPD server connection timeout.

Note:  Default hostname (as default setting in the config file) is localhost, port 0, timeout 0

Debug Options:
  mpd_pi [ -v ]  -Print version to command line then exit
  mpd_pi [ -V ]  -Print verbose stats to stdout command line.
  Multiple -V or -V=x  Verbose range 1 through 9. 10 or greater, show all.
    Level 1 - Conf Files,  Level 2 - Key Variables,  Level 3 - Set configuration,  Level 4 - Songview Variables.

  mpd_pi [ -R ]  -List Resources
  Resources may be extracted from mpd_pi as shown in the following example:
    gresource  extract mpd_pi /resources/RESOURCE_NAME  > RESOURCE_NAME-extracted



If you don't already have an MPD Server on your network, you will need to install and configure the Music Player Daemon server
mpd
mpc

If you want to modify the code and/or configure mpd_pi you may need to install
glade
devhelp
A code text editor such as scite, vim, gedit or any text editor should work.

mpd_pi does not have an install option. If you set up the directory structure as I have here, mpd_pi should work 
from any directory on your hard drive. Then link mpd_pi executable to an applet in the panel.
